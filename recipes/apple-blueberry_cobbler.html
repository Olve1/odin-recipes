    <h1>Apple-Blueberry Cobbler</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This recipe was inspired by camping trips I used to take with my family when I was younger. Originally,
         this cobbler was made using huckleberries, and baked over a campfire; but since I no longer live in
          an area where I can get huckleberries and don't have a constant campfire going, I substituted frozen
           wild blueberries and baked it in the oven instead. I also use a homemade apple beer in the batter,
            but use whatever hard cider or fruity beer you like.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Gala apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/16-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen wild blueberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
